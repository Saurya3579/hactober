# Hactoberfest


### What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean and DEV.


Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community.
To participate, four pull requests must be submitted to public GitHub repositories.
You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.



### How do I get started?

First, register at hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com. Then, submit at least four PRs to any public GitHub repository. You can look for open issues labeled Hacktoberfest for inspiration. Quality contributions are encouraged!


Are you maintaining a repo? Create issues or label existing ones with Hacktoberfest on your GitHub projects to help new contributors know what to work on. Tag any spam or irrelevant PRs with the invalid label to disqualify them.
